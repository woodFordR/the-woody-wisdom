# The Dark Days of December

When winter begins in December, I tend to become more focused on the next summer. Maybe it 
is a way of creating inner hope that it will be warm again soon? Maybe it is another way of 
triggering an exercise routine and better diet plan? I've recently been answering these questions 
with more scheduling and a better process throughout my day. The real struggle is trying to 
identify where in my life can I adapt and change to stop the failing cycle each year. The days 
are shorter and there's less time for self care which makes the challenge a bit more necessary.
